The Trans Patient Union is a coalition by and for trans and nonbinary patients receiving or trying to receive care in Tio’tia:ke (colonially known as Montreal). We believe that the experiences and inputs of trans and NB patients are necessary in the process of developing acceptable trans and NB medical care standards. As such, we consult with other queer/trans organizations, medical advocacy groups, and the Student Society of McGill University (SSMU) and to advocate for better standards of care at clinics in the city, such as at the McGill Student Wellness Hub.

Additionally, the TPU aims to help trans and NB patients better navigate their medical, social, and institutional transitions in broader Montreal through one-on-one assistance and resource. DM us on [instagram]({{site.instagram}}) or [email us](mailto:{{site.email}}) for any transition related troubleshooting in Montreal or beyond. 

We are always looking for new trans and NB people to join our organization, contribute to our projects, and attend our weekly meetings. Have input or experiences you want to share but don’t have time to get involved? Critical to our organization are our one-on-one consultations with trans and NB patients in the broader community. We highly encourage all trans and NB patients getting care in the city to sign up for an [interview](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaSSFFmY4NMLWJDhsdH9w7v1bp1lVxfz1RK9ZKbTtqKQc6g/viewform) with our Patient Reporting coordinator. Alternatively, please [email them](mailto:{{site.reporting_email}}).

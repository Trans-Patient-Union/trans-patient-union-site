The Trans Patient Union is a McGill students’ coalition group by and for trans and nonbinary patients at McGill. We believe that the experiences and inputs of trans & NB patients are necessary in the process of developing acceptable trans & NB medical care standards. As such, we consult with the Student Society of McGill University, other LGBTQ+ and medical student organizations, the EDIC Subcommittee on Queer People, and to advocate for better standards of care at the McGill Student Wellness Hub for trans & NB patients. 

Additionally, the TPU aims to help trans & NB students better navigate their medical, social, and institutional transitions at McGill and in Montreal, through one-on-one assistance and resource and guide creation. DM us on [instagram](https://instagram.com/{{site.instagram_username}}) or [email us](mailto:{{site.email}}) for any transition related troubleshooting in Montreal or beyond. 

We are always looking for new trans & NB people to join our committees, attend our biweekly meetings, or help out with supporting tasks. Have input or experiences you want to share but don’t have time to get involved? Critical to our organization are our one-on-one consultations with ordinary trans & NB patients. We highly encourage all trans & NB patients at McGill (Hub patient or not) to sign up for an [interview](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaSSFFmY4NMLWJDhsdH9w7v1bp1lVxfz1RK9ZKbTtqKQc6g/viewform) with our Patient Reporting coordinator.

The TPU is a working group of [Queer McGill](https://www.queermcgill.org/) and a workgroup of [QPIRG McGill](https://qpirgmcgill.org/), we are extremely grateful for the financial and other forms of support, without which the TPU could not function as it does today.

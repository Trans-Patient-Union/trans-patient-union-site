## Insurances

For SSMU and PGSS members, unless you opted out, Canadians have the full StudentCare coverage, and international students have partial coverage that complements their Blue Cross international insurance which include GAC. 

Often, you need a diagnosis for gender dysphoria in order to acces the healthcare coverage offered by Student Care, please refer to our guide on how to [obtain a gender dysphoria diagnosis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtC4NH0YoKTqmOydDV_89G4fNKE9Kdd_7XjrreP5vuA)

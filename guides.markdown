#### [Legal Name Change Flowcharts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EBOgUek9VibksaYJkAK7YoLOBAZlY_NoLDg_8kbpcfE)

#### Trans ID Clinic
- A fantastic name and sex marker change clinic that pops up a few times a month. Usually in Montreal but sometimes elsewhere in Quebec. Dates and info advertised on [Celeste Trainon’s instagram](https://www.instagram.com/celestetrianon/).

- You show up with the paperwork they ask and they help you do the whole process in one sitting.

- In the past, Celeste has also taken care of professional translations associated with filling name/sex marker change paperwork if you are born outside of Quebec and your birth certificate isn’t in French. 

#### Center for Gender Advocacy
- They provide an ID change service with a commissioner of oath if you reach out and ask. Please [email them](mailto:info@genderadvocacy.org)

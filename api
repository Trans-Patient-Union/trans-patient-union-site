Wow, you are trying to WFUZZ this site, aren't you? Well, you are not going to get 
anything from here. This isn't a hackathon challenge. There is no hidden flag,
no hidden directory, no hidden file, no hidden anything. If you are trying to 
find a way to get into the server, you are out of luck, because this site is
hosted on GitHub Pages.

Instead, would you like to join the Trans Patient Union at McGill? We are always
looking for new members, and I could certainly use some help with this website.
If you are interested, please email us! The address can be found on the site.

Nevertheless, I am impressed that you found this hidden file. I hope you have a
nice day! :)

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and
desert you, never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell
a lie and hurt you.

### Montreal HRT Project
Many trans patients struggle for years to access HRT. The process is obscure, waitlists can be years long, and  providers sometimes have transphobic and outdated practices. To help make the process simpler for patients andto improve transparency we are working on a comprehensive patient-run HRT providers list, which will document  patient experiences and provide critical information like pre-prescription practices.

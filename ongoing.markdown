### Montreal HRT Provider Database
Many trans patients struggle for years to access HRT. The process is obscure, waitlists can be years long, and  providers sometimes have transphobic and outdated practices. To help make the process simpler for patients, and to improve transparency, we are working on a comprehensive patient-sourced HRT providers list that will document patient experiences and provide critical information like pre-prescription practices.

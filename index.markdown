# We Want to Hear Your Experiences with Transition!

We cannot make these critical resources or advocate for better care without patients like you who take the time to tell us about your transition experiences. We highly encourage patients at McGill and in Montreal to meet with us or fill out our surveys. 

- Reach out for an [interview](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKaSSFFmY4NMLWJDhsdH9w7v1bp1lVxfz1RK9ZKbTtqKQc6g/viewform) with us in person (coffee/tea are on us) or over zoom.

- You can also anonymously report your experiences with McGill's Student Wellness Hub with our [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWWUuNY1q_Tp2kmBF4lTsoAHnqWHrjpzKwp9pJGobXwKA8ag/viewform).

- Comments, suggestions, or feedback on Trans Patient Union Resources? Please feel free to share them in our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerZAVmm0v3k6GNB3GGfWLwHsOEXGFuTqXM7C5c4MM1GmBhHw/viewform)

# About Us
The Trans Patient Union is an advocacy and mutual aid collective by and for trans and nonbinary patients at McGill and in broader Tio’tia:ke (colonially known as Montreal). The TPU believes that the experiences and insights of trans and nonbinary patients are necessary for the development of good standards of care. We also believe it is critical that patients have access to tools to navigate medical institutions, and quality information on standards of care so they can advocate for themselves in accessing care. As such, at the TPU we advocate to improve the standards of care for trans and nonbinary patients at the McGill Wellness Hub. Additionally, we provide resources and one on one assistance to trans and NB people navigating the medical, legal, and institutional difficulties of transitioning at McGill and in Tio’tia:ke.
